visualization of budget


On start: Check to see if user already has a budget started

    if no budget has started 
        have a page that says "create new budget" 
        with a form asking for "income and name of budget"
            - (this will create a budget with a given income and preset categories)
            
            - Then you will be given a table with categories and the percentages 
            of your income they consume. 
            
            - User will be able to: 
                adjust category percentages, 
                add new categories, 
                delete existing categories. 
                add subbudget for weeks and days 

                Maybe later: 
                Add a large yearly overview of income and how it effects your anual income

            
            -Track speninng by:
                adding and deleting line items spent through the 
                duration of their budget timeline and its subbudgets
